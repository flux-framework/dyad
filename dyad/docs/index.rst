DYAD: Dynamic and Asynchronous Data Streamliner
===============================================

DYAD is a synchronization and data movement tool for computational science workflows built
on top of Flux. DYAD aims to provide the benefits of in situ and in transit tools
(e.g., fine-grained synchronization between producer and consumer applications, fast data
access due to spatial locality) while relying on a file-based data abstraction to maximize
portability and minimize code change requirements for workflows.
More specifically, DYAD aims to overcome the following challenges
associated with traditional shared-storage and modern in situ and in transit data movement approaches:

* Lack of per-file object synchronization in shared-storage approaches
* Poor temporal and spatial locality in shared-storage approaches
* Poor performance for file metadata operations in shared-storage approaches (and possibly some in situ and in transit approaches)
* Poor portability and the introduction of required code changes for in situ and in transit approaches

In resolving these challenges, DYAD aims to provide the following to users:

* Good performance (similar to in situ and in transit) due to on- or near-node temporary storage of data
* Transparent per-file object synchronization between producer and consumer applications
* Little to no code change to existing workflows to achieve the previous benefits
