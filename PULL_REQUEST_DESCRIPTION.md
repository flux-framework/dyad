# Pull Request Summary

## Description
This pull request adds comprehensive documentation and AI integration features to the DYAD App.

## Changes Made

### Documentation
- Added `DOCUMENTATION.md` with detailed information about:
  - Project overview
  - Key components
  - Core C API functions
  - Python bindings and usage
  - AI integration with Ollama
  - Dependencies and licensing information
- Updated `README.md` to reference the new documentation and Python components

### AI Integration
- Added Ollama integration with both CLI and GUI interfaces:
  - `pydyad/ollama_cli.py`: Command-line interface for interacting with Ollama models
  - `pydyad/ollama_gui.py`: Graphical interface for interacting with Ollama models
  - `pydyad/pydyad/ollama_integration.py`: Core integration functions for running Ollama models
- Added C extension for calling Ollama models:
  - `pydyad/pydyad/dyad_ollama.c`: C extension implementation

### Examples and Tests
- Added `example_usage.py`: Example script demonstrating how to use the DYAD Python bindings
- Added test scripts for verifying the C extension functionality:
  - `test_cext_simple.py`: Simple test for basic C extension functionality
  - `test_cext_comprehensive.py`: More comprehensive test for C extension functionality

### Setup
- Updated `pydyad/setup.py` to include the new modules and C extension
- Updated `pydyad/pydyad/__init__.py` to export the new modules

## Usage
After merging these changes, users will be able to:
1. Access comprehensive documentation in `DOCUMENTATION.md`
2. Use the CLI interface to interact with Ollama models:
   ```
   cd pydyad && python ollama_cli.py
   ```
3. Use the GUI interface to interact with Ollama models:
   ```
   cd pydyad && python ollama_gui.py
   ```
4. Use the Python bindings in their own applications with the example in `example_usage.py`

## Dependencies
- Requires Ollama to be installed for the AI integration features
- Requires FLUX framework for the core DYAD functionality (as before)

## License
All new code is provided under the same LGPL-3.0 license as the rest of the project.
